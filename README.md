# AirFarePricePrediction
The price of an airline ticket is affected by a number of factors, such as ﬂight distance, purchasing time,number of stops, destination, source etc. Each carrier has its own proprietary rules and algorithms to set the price accordingly. Recent advance in Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) makes it possible to infer such rules and model the price variation.
The framework achieves a high prediction accuracy with 0.897 adjusted R squared score on the testing dataset using the random forest regression model.
